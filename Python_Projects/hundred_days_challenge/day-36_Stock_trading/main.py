# TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").
if percentage_difference > 5:
    print("Get news!")
## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.

# TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

# TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint:

## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

# TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

# TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.


# Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
"""
